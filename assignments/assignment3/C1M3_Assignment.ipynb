    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will work with [Weaviate API](https://weaviate.io/) to build a tiny RAG system. You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load a [collection](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/collections) for BBC News data.\n",
    "- Use the Weaviate API to retrieve documents from the vector database.\n",
    "- Create functions to retrieve data based on Semantic Search, BM25 and Hybrid Search (using RRF) using the Weaviate API.\n",
    "- Use an LLM to generate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: This assignment assumes you know how to handle simple tasks with collections in the Weaviate API. If you are not familiar with it yet, please read the Ungraded Lab on the Weaviate API! Furthermore, the data you will be working here is already *chunked*. You can get more hands-on experience on chunking reading the Ungraded Lab on chunking!"

      "Title: US interest rates cut by 0.5% in first drop in four years, Chunk: now see inflation falling faster and unemployment rising higher than they did in June, with the jobless rate expected to hit 4.4% by the end of the 2024. Mr Powell said the job market had been too hot last year, and he welcomed some cooling, but he denied that the Fed was worried about the start of a serious slowdown. \"I do not see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood... of a downturn is elevated,\" he said. Over the three months to June, the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3%, the most recent Commerce Department figures show. Retail spending has also remained resilient. Inflation, meanwhile, dropped to 2.5% in August, moving closer, Published at: 2024-09-18 20:46:36+00:00\n",

      "Title: What is a recession and how could one affect me?, Chunk: time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called \"stagflation\". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC that the UK economy had \"turned a corner\". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy in the G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economy grew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance, Published at: 2024-05-10 08:11:34+00:00\n",

The country has one of the highest murder rates in Latin America, with police recording around 8,000 violent deaths in 2023. This has made Ecuador an increasingly unsafe destination for tourists, who are starting to avoid the country.\n",

      "3. Rising female leadership: The role of women in Latin America's politics is transforming rapidly. As many countries head towards the polls, women are increasingly taking on prominent roles, challenging the traditional power dynamics. Nations such as Mexico, which is at the forefront of this transformation, see a growing number of female candidates emerging, hoping to lead their countries.\n",

With more women entering politics, their options have expanded beyond the passive role traditionally assigned to them. Several women have challenged this reduced responsibility and have instead enlisted to participate actively in administration and programs.\n",
