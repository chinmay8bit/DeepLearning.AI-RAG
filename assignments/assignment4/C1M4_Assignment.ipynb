    "# Programming Assignment: Developing a RAG-based Chatbot\n",
    "---\n",
    "Welcome to your fourth assignment in the RAG course! Having acquired foundational techniques, you are now ready to embark on building a more sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. In this assignment, you will undertake the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM routing**: Develop functions to help categorize and identify the type of each query, creating a router that, depending on the query nature, different treatments are performed.\n",
    "- **Conditional parameter setting**: Create methods to determine if a user’s query is creative or technical. This allows the LLM to adjust its settings to give the best answer.\n",
    "- **Producing JSON Responses**: Program the LLMs to generate valid JSON responses with product information, making sure the output is organized for more processing if needed.\n",
    "- **Adding Contextual Information**: Include relevant data in queries before they are handled by the LLM.\n",
    "- **Chatbot Development**: Create a chatbot that can interact with users in a natural and efficient way, answering their questions clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply the skills you've learned to integrate RAG capabilities into a RAG system that will support a ChatBot."

    "    Think about how to effectively integrate the FAQ content into your prompt. The variable <code>FAQ_LAYOUT</code> already holds the FAQ data, so you can include it directly in your prompt using an f-string. For example, start with something like <code>You will be provided with an FAQ for a clothing store.</code> Then, give the model clear instructions, such as:\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "        <li>Use multiple FAQ answers if necessary.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Only answer the question asked.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary style=\"color: green;\"><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>\n",
    "    Use a placeholder like <code>{FAQ_LAYOUT}</code> in your prompt to include the FAQ data. This ensures the LLM has the full context to generate accurate answers. A helpful format might be:  \n",
    "    <code>&lt;FAQ&gt;<br>PROVIDED FAQ: {FAQ_LAYOUT}<br>&lt;/FAQ&gt;</code>\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary style=\"color: green;\"><strong>Hint 3</strong></summary>\n",
    "    After constructing your <code>prompt</code>, use <code>generate_params_dict</code> to create the parameters, passing in your prompt and any required keyword arguments. Then, call <code>generate_with_single_input</code> using your prompt to get the model’s response.\n",

    "    INFERENCE RULES\n",
    "    ────────────────────────\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Implicit Color Inference**\n",
    "      - Infer colors based on semantic context.\n",
    "      - Think about the purpose, mood, and environment:\n",
    "        * What colors are **practical** for this context?\n",
    "        * What colors match the **cultural/social expectations**?\n",
    "        * What colors align with the **activity or weather**?\n",
    "      - If color cannot be reasonably inferred from context, use [\"Any\"]\n",
    "      - Otherwise, return 3-5 appropriate colors\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Usage & Occasion Reasoning**\n",
    "      - Map events and activities to usage:\n",
    "        - Office, meetings → \"Formal\"\n",
    "        - Travel, daily wear → \"Casual\"\n",
    "        - Gym, running → \"Sports\"\n",
    "        - Festivals, parties → \"Party\"\n",
    "      - If usage is not clear, use [\"Any\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Season Inference**\n",
    "      - Infer season from climate, location, weather, or material cues:\n",
    "        - \"Summer\", \"beach\", \"tropical\", \"sunny\", \"hot\", \"warm\" → \"Summer\"\n",
    "        - \"Winter\", \"cold\", \"layering\", \"chilly\", \"snow\" → \"Winter\"\n",
    "        - \"Spring\", \"fall\", \"autumn\", \"rainy\" → \"Spring\"\n",
    "      - **Important**: Use \"All seasons\" IF AND ONLY IF the user EXPLICITLY requests year-round/all-season items:\n",
    "        - \"all year\", \"year-round\", \"all seasons\", \"versatile for any season\" → \"All seasons\"\n",
    "      - If NO seasonal cues can be inferred, you must default to [\"Any\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Price Handling**\n",
    "      - If a maximum or range is mentioned, respect it.\n",
    "      - If no price is specified, default to:\n",
    "        {{\"min\": 0, \"max\": \"inf\"}}\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Defaults**\n",
    "      - If a category is not constrained by the query or inference, use [\"Any\"].\n",
    "      - Every field must be present in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ────────────────────────\n",
    "    OUTPUT FORMAT\n",
    "    ────────────────────────\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return **only** a JSON object with the following keys:\n",
